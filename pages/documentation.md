After you fill in an inquiry, I will get in touch with you for a first consultation! We will discuss the date’s availability, and you may tell me more about your special day and what you’re looking for. I will ask you guided questions and show you examples to pick from to ascertain your vision and walk you through they will be brought to life. Since we are (literally!) working with a blank canvas the customisations are endless! So, I am always happy to extend a consult or have a second in-depth round to explore more ideas – art styles, lighting options, any elements to emphasise or minimise – with you to your hearts content. We will keep in touch till the wedding date to include any additional ideas that may arise or accommodate event changes.
